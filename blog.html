            So I was trying to listen to music though Spotify with my Alexa, right but FOR SOME REASON, it wouldn't let me play
            the songs in my playlist. It played songs that I've NEVER heard. I looked up how to fix this and it came with a price tag. Spotify wants me to pay <span style="font-size: 140%; color: red;">$12.00 A MONTH</span>
            for the <span style="font-size: 140%; color: red;">BARE MINIMUM OF A MUSIC APP.</span> I get that Spotify
            needs to make people get premium, but this is <span style="font-size: 140%; color: red;">EXCESSIVE.</span>
            I think I would be better with VINYL RECORDS. I may sound like a crazy person (I am), but you don't know how <span style="font-size: 140%; color: red;">ANNOYING</span>
            it is to try to play "LOVE.", by Kendrick Lamar, but instead play "4 BIG GUYS", by DigBar (not an entirely true story).
            So I deleted Spotify, and downloaded Amazon Music. It didn't connect to my Alexa, AND IT HAD <span style="font-size: 140%; color: red;">THE SAME ISSUE HAS SPOTIFY.</span>
            Who thought this was a good idea? I WANT THEM <span style="font-size: 140%; color: red;">FIRED.</span>
            And that's not even the end of it, THERE'S MORE TO THIS NEVER-ENDING STORY. I deleted Spotify, and downloaded Pandora. But guess what!?
            <span style="font-size: 230%; color: red;">PANDORA DOESN'T HAVE PLAYLISTS.</span>
